## First Section :

### Priorities (In Descending Order)-

1. Attitude: Hype up yourself AND MORE IMPORTANTLY everyone you have worked with. Everyone wants a positive-vibed person in their office. 

2. Knowledge: Every company will limit themselves to: Your resume + Job Description. That's all they want and all you have to keep revising. 

3. 7 Level Questions: Assume each initial Question will have 7 more questions asked around it. 

### Explanations:

**3 Reasons Why Positive Attitude is the most important factor:** 

Companies can risk teaching technical skills to a candidate but cannot risk the following- 

A. Lack of Passion: No company wants to hire someone who will get depressed in 10 days and possibly quit in 30. 

What they want to see-> A candidate who wants to be the best at whatever they do. 

B. Lack of Loyalty: No company wants to be dealing with insider threats and corporate espionage. 

What they want to see-> A candidate who sees the companies' success as their own. 

C. Lack of Likeability: No company wants to deal with HR crises or lack of co-operation during emergencies. 

What they want to see-> A candidate who is consistently great with people. 2. Two Reasons 

**Why external Q&A is a gigantic waste of time:** 

Going through external Questions and Answer lists is a God-Awful, Sad little strategy for getting roles.

A. Candidates will only be asked general questions if their resume does not give much scope for asking or they fail to answer resume based questions. 

B. Whenever asked another question; candidates seek to use prepared answer around unrelated question OR even worse when prepared question is asked candidates answer in a droning robotic manner. 

**One Reason Why you need 7 level Questioning:** 

Answer: After 5 meaningful levels you have dug out root causes. After 7 levels you have dug out systemic causes; and everyone wants a candidate who brings an eagle-eye view to the to-do list.

Rules of Preparation

- Design and conduct all your mock interviews yourself; write down a list of 15 broad questions and drill yourself around them. 

- Prepare a short bio about yourself beforehand to introduce yourself; including your end goal and why the security field.

- Be certain to ask about feedback at the end of the interviewÂ since this is a make or break factor for many interviewers. 

- Lastly all mock interviews must be done on camera; so you can realistically assess yourself every time.

# Interview Tips (Information Security)
This page is a summary of interviews I have been through, covered a decent breadth of roles, got multiple rejects however, learned from each interview, collected constructive feedbacks and went ahead.
Hope these questions/ tips could help you.

TL;dr:- Don't make the interviewers cringe and you're okay.

First Section : Priorities (In Descending Order)
1. Attitude: Hype up yourself AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, everyone you have worked with. Everyone wants a positive-vibed person in their office.
2. Knowledge: Every company will limit themselves to: Your resume + Job Description. That's all they want, and all you have to keep revising.
3. 7 Level Questions: Assume each initial Question will have 7 more questions asked around it.

Explanations:
1. 3 Reasons Why Positive Attitude is the most important factor:
Companies can risk teaching technical skills to a candidate, but cannot risk the following-
A. Lack of Passion: No company wants to hire someone who will get depressed in 10 days, and possibly quit in 30. 
What they want to see-> A candidate who wants to be the best at whatever they do.
B.  Lack of Loyalty: No company wants to be dealing with insider threats, especially in the security department.
What they want to see-> A candidate who sees the companies' success as their own.
C. Lack of Likeability: No company wants to deal with HR crises, or lack of co-operation during emergencies.
What they want to see-> A candidate who is consistently great with people.

2. Two Reasons Why external Q&A is a gigantic waste of time:
A. Candidates will only be asked general questions if their resume does not give much scope for asking, or they fail 
to answer resume based questions.
B. Whenever asked another question; candidates seek to use prepared answer around unrelated question OR even worse, when prepared question
is asked, candidates answer in a droning, robotic manner. 

3. One Reason Why you need 7 level Questioning:
Answer: After 5 meaningful levels, you have dug out root causes. After 7 levels, you have dug out systemic causes; and everyone wants a candidate
who brings an eagle-eye view to the to-do list.

Preparation Rules:
- Design and conduct all your mock interviews yourself; write down a list of 15 questions, and drill yourself around them.
- Prepare a short bio about yourself beforehand to introduce yourself; including your end goal and why infosec?
- Be certain to ask about feedback at the end of the interview, *why, because:* this is a make or break factor for many interviewers.
- Lastly, all mock interviews must be done on camera; so you can realistically assess yourself every time.
